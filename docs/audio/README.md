# Audio placeholders

This folder is for your Opus/AAC files referenced by `docs/manifest.json`.

Files expected:

- `clip001.opus` and `clip001.m4a`
- `clip002.opus` and `clip002.m4a`
- ...
- `clip100.opus` and `clip100.m4a`

Replace with your actual audio files. The page will load and play each clip
when you click its Play button.
